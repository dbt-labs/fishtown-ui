## 1. Add a new component

Components are stored in /components, in their own sub-directories. Each subdirectory holds

- Component.tsx - the main component file
- Component.stories.tsx - a file containing all the stories (component preview in storybook) and configurations
- Component.test.tsx - Component jest tests.
- index.ts - an index file for the folder, exporting at the very least `export * from './Component'`
- (optional) component.css - a corresponding css file for your component, this must also be imported within `/components/custom-components.css`

## 2. Build new component functionality

- Create your component following our [Getting Started](?path=/story/docs-getting-started--page) and [Code Practices](?path=/story/docs-code-practices--page) guides.
- Write unit tests for your component using jest

## 3. Build documentation for your component

- Document all props for your component using JSDoc style comments

```tsx
export interface MyProps {
  /** A short description of what this prop does */
  someProp: string;
}
```

- Create stories to showcase all props of your component, depending on the component this may mean a single story that allows a developer to configure
  each prop or doing custom configurations of props in multiple stories to highlight specific functionality.
